# Cinderlib-CSI on Kubevirt

To use the Cinderlib-CSI driver on Kubevirt we need to make changes to our deployment.

The easiest way to make the changes is to copy this kubevirt directory into a directory of the kubevirt repository, and run the `csi_up.sh` script from there after the cluster is up and running.

For now the example only supports single node deployments, and for convenience we are using a pod instead of a StatefulSet and DaemonSets and the permissions are too broad.

Given the following assumptions:

- This `kubevirt` directory is in `$cl_example`.
- We have modified `X_CSI_BACKEND_CONFIG` environmental variable in the `csi.yml` (example is for XtremIO).
- Our current working directory is `kubevirt` repository's root directory.
- We haven't created a kubevirt cluster yet.

The following commands will create the cluster, make changes to the cluster to support CSI plugins, deploy the CSI plugin, create a PVC, and an app that uses the PVC:


```
make cluster-up
make cluster-sync

# Modify the cluster for CSI
csi/csi_up.sh

# Setup RBAC
cluster/kubectl.sh csi/rbac.yml

# Setup the CSI driver
cluster/kubectl.sh csi/csi.yml

# Create a PVC (creates a volume on the storage via the CSI plugin)
cluster/kubectl.sh csi/pvc.yml

# Create an APP that uses the created volume
cluster/kubectl.sh csi/app.yml
```
